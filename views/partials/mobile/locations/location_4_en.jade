    p(class="content-text-mobile") Random Rules is a collection of rules oriented towards the bodily perception and relations coming from two very opposite sources and places of narrative - pop and religious context found in places around the Museum of Contemporary Art - shopping center and a church. By creating a unified set of rules their original source is sometimes hard to identify. The contrast between the two extremes finds its common ground and value through the reappropriation in an online material.
